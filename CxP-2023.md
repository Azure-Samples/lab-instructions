## Bringing it all together with MSAL

**In this article**
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Lab 01: MSAL JS Angular Single-Page Application](#lab-01-msal-js-angular-single-page-application)

## Prerequisites

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Have your favorite text editor open and ready. We'll be using Visual Studio 2022.

Ideally, install Visual Studio 2022, checking **ASP.NET and web development**, and **.NET Core cross-platform development**, or otherwise, install [ASP.NET Core 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

We'll be walking through the following pre-configured MSAL samples, if you want to `git clone` and have them ready:

[MSAL JS Single-Page Angular Application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-angular-spa)

**Optional**
The samples are pre-configured and will work "out of the box", but if you have time and interest, you can configure your own B2C tenant and use that configuration instead:
[B2C Test Tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant)

## Lab 01: MSAL JS Angular Single-Page Application

A Single-Page Application (SPA) signing-in with B2C.

### Run the SPA

- `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-tutorial.git`

- `cd 1-Authentication/2-sign-in-b2c/SPA`

- Install Node.Js if you haven't already

- Install and update the Node dependencies

    `npm install && npm update`

    `npm start`
